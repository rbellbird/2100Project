            We are part of the Web of Life, that intricate, undeniably intimate weave that connects all things, animate and inanimate. I remember at age fifteen standing under a velvet, starlit sky at my rural home in the woods of CT. Its magnificence sent shivers throughout my body. I felt the stars and the dark night reach out and into me. That moment spurred on my pursuit of “the Divine," a pursuit that began through my Christian church and continued as I surveyed different religions and encountered other forms of spirituality.<br><br>

            Sometime later I came upon this quote from Albert Einstein. It affirmed and resonated deeply with my experience.<br><br>

            <div id="blockquote"><i>The most beautiful and most profound experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the sower of all true science. (S)he to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their primitive forms - this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness.</i><sup>1</sup></div><br>

            This sense of Awe, Mystery, Reverence and Wonder permeates most religions and manifests in a devotion to service and recognition of the Other through the Web of Life - what some call the Spirit.  This awareness of the Other is key to our survival, a realization that within the Web of Life everything and everyone is in cosmic, mystic, and fundamental relationship with the Other. This Web of connectedness is an ecological reality; if one suffers all suffer, if one is lifted up all are lifted up. It is said the flapping of the wings of a tiny butterfly can affect large changes elsewhere in the environment. It is not dissimilar to the Christian concept of the Body as a metaphor for the intimate connection of all people and things.<br><br>

            Examples of the Web of Life and initiatives to raise awareness of our connection are plentiful, such as that of Karen Armstrong, a former religious sister who initiated the Charter for Compassion after receiving the TED Prize in 2008. The Charter is now a world-wide, multi-religious endeavor to bring us a deeper and practical sense of our unity rather than our divisiveness in religious communities and the world. The Charter reads in part: “We believe that all human beings are born with the capacity for compassion, and that it must be cultivated for human beings to survive and thrive.” The Charter is now a world-wide, multi-faith and secular movement to salvage and restore earth communities.<sup>2</sup><br><br>
             
            My own denomination, the United Church of Christ, like many others, is committed to sustainability and promotes education, outreach and activism to save the planet and all its species - including humans. The Spirituality and Earth Stewardship Mission Group, “believing deeply that all creation is formed by a loving God, and that we are called to be wise and compassionate stewards of this good Earth” is actively engaged in initiatives to alleviate climate change and educate the church.<sup>3</sup><br><br>

            Buddhism is itself an ecological religion believing in the intricate web of life and from which we can learn about interconnectedness. The basis of its awareness and commitment lie in the heart of its religious precepts.<br><br>

            <div id="blockquote2"><i><ol>
            <li>Compassion is the basis for a balanced view of the whole world and of the environment.</li>
            <li>The use of the "save and not waste" approach means that nothing in nature is spoiled or wasted. Wanton destruction upsets the vital balance of life.</li>
            <li>Ecology is rebuilt through the philosophy of Sarvodaya (uplift of all), which is based on loving kindness, compassionate action, and altruistic joy.<sup>4</sup></li></ol></i></div>
            <br>

            Many Indigenous peoples all over the world hold at the core of their spirituality a deep conviction of the interrelatedness and Unity of all life in “the Great Spirit.” The Earth is considered sacred and all attempts are made to treat it as such.<br><br>

           It is my deepest conviction that Religion and Spirituality, at their best, contribute substantively to the positive regard of all life. Most of these practices see little division between the earthly and spiritual. In fact, the demarcation between the two does not exist. Modern physics and this more mystic appreciation of life walk hand in hand. Both shatter the boundaries of materiality and separation. We stand on the edge of some of the most amazing discoveries in our known history as these boundaries blur. All life is seen, in fact, to be of one ‘substance,’ spiritual AND material. Scientists have even named the Higgs Boson the ‘God Particle,’ assuming through theory and experiment that it is the particle of all particles, the essence of all essences. Some call this ‘substance’ Love or Spirit, the intimate, mystical, practical reality that unites all of life.<br><br>

            I close with Einstein:<br><br>

            <div id="blockquote"><i>
            The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenetrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties - this knowledge, this feeling ... that is the core of the true religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself among profoundly religious men.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br></div><br>
